## graphs

#### how do graphs work?
  * represent a set of connections
  * made up of:
    * _nodes_: things
    * _edges_: connection between the things
  * directly connected things are known as _neighbors_
  * what is the difference between a directed graph and an undirected graph?
    * with directed graphs, relationships only go one way (if an arrow points from Erlich to Jian-Yang but not from Jian-Yang to Erlich, Jian-Yang is Erlich's neighbor, but Erlich is not Jian-Yang's neighbor)
    * with undirected graphs, there are no arrows, so an edge represents a bi-directional relationship
  * __trees__ are graphs with edges that never point back to a connected node

#### use cases:
  * finding shortest distance between two points on a map
  * finding shortest chain of friends between two people on Facebook

#### implementation:
  * coming soon
